= Hello World

Famously, "Test Post, Please Ignore" is the inaugural start to new forums. And "Hello World" is the inaugural start to learning a new programming language. I do not expect this blog to be a crowning achievement, but rather a place to reflect and process new experiences. +

I certainly understand that the web is a place where once you've written something it cannot be recalled. And so my writing will likely be technical in nature, often with asides to myself or links to similar posts. If you should stumble upon this blog by accident or by happy chance, know that I welcome you, but my style is one I've learned over many years and is unlikely to change.

This is not an academic blog and while I will endeavor to cite things properly, I will not always succeed. Rather, this blog is for my own reference and collection.


IMPORTANT: This blog has a wide focus.
